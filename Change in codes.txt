Server Updates:
- The server now keeps track of how many attempts were made to guess the number.  
- Based on the number of tries, it provides a rating:  
  - Very Good for fewer than 5 attempts  
  - Good for 7–10 attempts  
  - Fair for more than 10 attempts  

Client Updates:
- A bot feature was added that allows automated guessing of the server's random number.  
- If the bot’s first guess is lower than the target number, it increases its next guess by 1.  
- If the initial guess is higher, it decreases the next guess by 1.
